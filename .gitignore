# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle
# Ignore editor files:
.byebug_history

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

# A common temp file that we never want committed:
t

# OS X:
.DS_Store

# Created during specs, but not desirable to keep them around:
spec/files/*diff

# Created when processing resources:
public/data
public/data/*
public/diff/*
public/converted_csv/*

# Never keep the secrets:
config/secrets.yml
docker/docker-compose.yml
docker/resources/secrets.yml

# Docker environment file is secret:
docker/.env

# vim swap files
*.swp
